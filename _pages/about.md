Welcome! I am the O.K. Earl postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working primarily with Dr. Jean-Philippe Avouac. I got my PhD (2023) from the Earth and Planetary Science Department at the University of California, Davis, advised by Dr. Mike Oskin. My PhD work combined field methods and remote sensing to address a variety of problems in earthquake and fault mechanics. My current research interests rely on using geologic and geodetic data to understand:

1. The mechanics of large earthquakes, especially multi-fault ones
2. The distribution of inelastic strain during earthquakes and over multiple earthquake cycles
3. Fault synchronization and earthquake clustering over millenial timescales
4. Probabilistic displacement hazard assessment for strike-slip faults

You can learn more about my research on the research tab. I am also passionate about mentoring undergraduates in research and have done so through UC Davis, the McNair program, and the SCEC SOURCES program.

I will be starting a faculty position in the Department of Geoscience at Utah State University in January 2025. I am recruiting Masters and PhD students for a variety of projects, get in touch if you are interested.
