Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Geosciences at Utah State University. Before, I was a postdoc in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, working primarily with Dr. Jean-Philippe Avouac. I got my PhD (2023) from the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department at the University of California, Davis, advised by Dr. Mike Oskin. My work relies on using geologic and geodetic data, and numerical models, to understand:
</p>

1. The role of fault geometrical complexity in the mechanics of large earthquakes
2. Long-term interactions between neighboring faults
3. The distribution of inelastic strain during earthquakes and over multiple earthquake cycles
4. The competition between tectonic deformation and surface processes in fault scarp evolution
5. Probabilistic displacement hazard assessment of surface rupturing earthquakes

You can learn about my work addressing these topics in the research tab. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, gravel biking, reading, and befriending dogs. I am also learning how to cross-country and alpine skii in the beautiful Utah snow.

**Prospective students:**

<p align="justify">
I am recruiting graduate students at USU at the MSc and PhD level. My research spans a wide range of methods, from spending time in the field collecting data (for example, mapping fracture distributions), to running numerical simulations in an external computer server (for example, to model fault interactions over timescales longer than those we can observe in the paleoseismic record). Ongoing projects reflect this breadth and I am happy and excited to bring in students with different training and backgrounds to the group, whether they want to spend their time in the field, processing remote sensing data in GIS, writing code, or doing a bit of it all! Send me an email if you're interested in working together and include your CV and a brief statement of your interests and how they align with my research program. You can reach me at alba.rodriguez@usu.edu . I also have funding to support undergraduate students (from USU or otherwise) for summer research projects, reach out if you are interested!
